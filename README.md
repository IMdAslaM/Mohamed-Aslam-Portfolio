**4) YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit**
-  I have Scrapped the channel's data from youtube, by connecting to youtube's API. And Stored the data in MongoDB in the form of Collections. Taking data from MongoDB and converting it to Pandas dataframe to insert the data to SQL database in the form table. Now we can do data analysis on the channel's data from SQL database.
- *Skills Used:* Python Scripting, Data Collection, Data Management Using SQL, MongoDB, Data Analysis, API Integration, Streamlit, Data Engineering
